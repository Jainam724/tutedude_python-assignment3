# Task 1: Calculate Factorial Using a Function

## Description:
This program defines a function named `factorial` that calculates the factorial of a number. The factorial is calculated using either a loop or recursion, depending on the implementation. The function is then called with a sample number, and the result is printed to the screen.

## Example:
For an input of `5`, the program will calculate and print the factorial, which is `120` (i.e., `5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120`).

## Output:
Enter a number: 5 Factorial of 5 is: 120

# Task 2: Using the Math Module for Calculations

## Description:
This program prompts the user to input a number and then uses the Python `math` module to perform the following calculations:

- **Square root** of the number
- **Natural logarithm** (log base e) of the number
- **Sine** of the number (in radians)

The program then displays the results of these calculations.

## Example:
If the user enters `25`, the program will display:
Square root of 25 is: 5.0 Natural logarithm of 25 is: 3.2188758248682006 Sine of 25 (radians) is: -0.13235175009777303
